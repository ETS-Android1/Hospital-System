# Hospital-System
This is an Android application to book hospital appointments, through which you can choose a specific specialty and then choose a doctor in this specialty where you display the working days of this doctor and choose the appropriate day for you.
You can also use the application to save all your previous medical tests to keep your doctor fully aware of your health condition.
The doctor can also specify his work hours and the hours he is in, and there is also a special login for the administrator who can add or delete any of the doctors in the hospital.
- I used Android studio with java
- I used MSSQL via a lan to store all information
